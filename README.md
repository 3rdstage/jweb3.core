### A Few Lies from ABI Spec

> The first four bytes of the call data for a function call specifies the function to be called.
> The return type of a function is not part of this signature. In Solidityâ€™s function overloading return types are not considered.
> The JSON description of the ABI however contains both inputs and outputs.
